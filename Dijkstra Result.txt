Step 1:
 Set distance of 1 to 0

Step 2:
 Add 1 to queue

Queue is not empty

Step 3:
 Remove 1 from queue

Step 4:
 Calculate distance of 2 = 1 + 3

Step 5:
 Distance of 2 is less than current distance
Remove 2 from queue and set distance.

Step 6:
 Add 2 to queue

Step 7:
 Calculate distance of 3 = 1 + 1

Step 8:
 Distance of 3 is less than current distance
Remove 3 from queue and set distance.

Step 9:
 Add 3 to queue

Step 10:
 Remove 3 from queue

Step 11:
 Calculate distance of 1 = 3 + 1

Step 12:
 Calculate distance of 2 = 3 + 5

Step 13:
 Remove 2 from queue

Step 14:
 Calculate distance of 1 = 2 + 3

Step 15:
 Calculate distance of 6 = 2 + 1

Step 16:
 Distance of 6 is less than current distance
Remove 6 from queue and set distance.

Step 17:
 Add 6 to queue

Step 18:
 Calculate distance of 5 = 2 + 1

Step 19:
 Distance of 5 is less than current distance
Remove 5 from queue and set distance.

Step 20:
 Add 5 to queue

Step 21:
 Calculate distance of 3 = 2 + 5

Step 22:
 Remove 6 from queue

Step 23:
 Calculate distance of 2 = 6 + 1

Step 24:
 Calculate distance of 5 = 6 + 1

Step 25:
 Remove 5 from queue

Step 26:
 Calculate distance of 2 = 5 + 1

Step 27:
 Calculate distance of 6 = 5 + 1

Queue is empty
